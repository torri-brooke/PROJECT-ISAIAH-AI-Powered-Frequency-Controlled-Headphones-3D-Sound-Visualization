# Frequency-Controlled Biofeedback Headphones with Visiual and Spatial Mapping

## Overview
This open-source project aims to develop an innovative headphone technology that combines:
- **Sound Frequency Detection:** Identify and analyze ambient sound frequencies in real-time.
- **Noise Cancellation:** Dynamically cancel, reduce or enhance specific frequencies to control your audio environment.
- **Biofeedback Integration:** Use biosensors to analyze, pinpoint and adapt audio based on user responses (e.g., stress, focus, relaxation).
- **Visual and Spatial Mapping:** Detect the origin and direction of sounds in a 3D space and map them for enhanced situational awareness.

Our goal is to empower users to create customized soundscapes, improve safety and spatial awareness, and foster collaboration to drive innovation in audio technology.

## Features
1. **Real-Time Sound Frequency Detection**
   - Analyze ambient audio frequencies with precision.
   - Integrate adaptive sound cancellation to enhance comfort and focus.

2. **Active Noise Control (ANC)**
   - Cancel unwanted background noise in real time.
   - Allow selective pass-through of specific sounds (e.g., voices, alerts).

3. **Biofeedback Integration**
   - Incorporate biosensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate) to monitor user responses.
   - Adjust audio output based on emotional or cognitive states.

4. **Visual and Spatial Mapping**
   - Use microphones and sensors to detect the origin and direction of sound.
   - Map detected sound sources in a 3D environment.
   - Provide visual feedback through a companion app or AR/VR interface.

## Applications
- **Personalized Audio Control:** Create immersive and distraction-free environments for productivity or relaxation.
- **Safety and Situational Awareness:** Enhance awareness of surroundings for activities like commuting, hiking, or biking.
- **Assistive Technology:** Help individuals with hearing impairments by visually mapping sound origins.
- **Gaming and Entertainment:** Offer immersive spatial audio experiences in AR/VR environments.
- **Research and Development:** Enable experimentation with sound and biofeedback for health and cognitive studies.
