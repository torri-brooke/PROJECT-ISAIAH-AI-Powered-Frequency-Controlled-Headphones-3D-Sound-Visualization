# AI-Powered Frequency-Controlled Headphones with 3D Sound Visualization and User Override

## Overview
This open-source project combines advanced AI-powered audio and visual technologies to enable users to shape their auditory and visual environments with unparalleled precision. By integrating AI-driven sound frequency detection, noise modulation, biofeedback, and 3D visualization through AR glasses or other visual technologies, users can enhance situational awareness, safety, and creativity—all while maintaining full control of the technology.

## Features

### **AI-Powered Sound Frequency Detection**
- AI analyzes and identifies ambient audio frequencies in real time for precise sound adjustments.
- Users can fine-tune or override AI decisions for complete customization.

### **AI-Driven Noise Modulation**
- Dynamically cancel, amplify, or modify specific ambient sounds based on AI-processed data.
- Enable user-defined presets and manual overrides to maintain control of sound environments.

### **AI-Enhanced 3D Sound Visualization Technology**
- Use AR glasses or visual displays to map sound sources in a 3D environment.
- Visualize the origin, direction, and intensity of sound in real time for enhanced situational awareness.
- Customize visual overlays for sound categories (e.g., alarms, voices) and receive critical alerts.

### **AI-Powered Biofeedback Integration**
- Collect physiological data (e.g., heart rate, EEG) to adapt soundscapes dynamically.
- AI suggests sound environments tailored to relaxation, focus, or safety, while allowing manual adjustments.
- Visualize biofeedback data in real-time through the companion app or AR interface.
