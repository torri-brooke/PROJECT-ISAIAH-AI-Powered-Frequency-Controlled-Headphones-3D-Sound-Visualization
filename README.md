# AI-Powered Frequency-Controlled Headphones with Noise Modulation, Biofeedback Technology, 3D Sound Visualization and User Override

## Overview
This open-source project combines AI-powered audio and visual technologies to create a fully customizable auditory and visual experience. By integrating advanced sound frequency detection, noise modulation, and visual mapping through AR glasses or other visual technology, users can view and interact with sound in a 3D environment. 

Key features include:
- **AI-Powered Sound Frequency Detection:** Real-time analysis of sound frequencies for precise audio adjustments.
- **AI-Driven Noise Modulation:** Cancel, enhance, or modify sound while maintaining user control.
- **3D Sound Visualization Technology:** Use AR glasses or other visual devices to map the origin and movement of sound in a 3D space.
- **AI-Powered Biofeedback Integration:** Adapt audio environments based on user biofeedback, with full override and manual customization.

This project is designed to enhance personal safety, productivity, and awareness by blending AI-driven automation with user autonomy.

## Features

### **AI-Powered Sound Frequency Detection**
- Analyze ambient audio frequencies in real time using AI for precise sound classification and adjustment.
- Detect complex soundscapes and adapt dynamically while allowing users to fine-tune and override AI settings.

### **AI-Driven Noise Modulation**
- Automatically cancel, amplify, or modify specific sounds based on user preferences and AI insights.
- Customize your sound environment for work, relaxation, or situational awareness with easy manual overrides.

### **3D Sound Visualization Technology**
- Leverage AR glasses, smart goggles, or a companion app to visualize sound sources in a 3D environment.
- Map the direction, distance, and intensity of sounds in real time using AI-enhanced spatial detection.
- Use visual overlays to display sound categories (e.g., alarms, voices, or nature) and customize visual alerts for critical sounds.
- Enhance situational awareness for safety, navigation, and immersive experiences.

### **AI-Powered Biofeedback Integration**
- Use biosensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate) to gather physiological data and adjust sound environments intelligently.
- AI suggests optimal settings for focus, relaxation, or alertness while ensuring users can override and modify these suggestions.
- Combine biofeedback with visual technology to display stress levels or relaxation indicators in the 3D environment.

   - Identify critical sounds like alarms or voices through visual alerts.

2. **Safety and Navigation**
   - Use 3D sound visualization to locate sounds in emergency situations or crowded spaces.
   - Amplify and visualize critical sounds while suppressing unnecessary noise.

3. **Immersive Experiences**
   - Enhance gaming, AR, and VR experiences with AI-driven spatial audio and 3D sound visualization.
   - Provide real-time interaction with soundscapes for entertainment or creative applications.

4. **Assistive Technology**
   - Help individuals with hearing impairments by visually mapping sound sources and providing enhanced audio customization.

5. **Health and Wellness**
   - Use AI and biofeedback to create calming soundscapes or focus-enhancing environments.
   - Visualize stress-reduction progress in real time through the companion app or AR display.
