Title: "Harmony Sound: An Open-Source Framework for Advanced-Noise Canceling Technology"

Abstract:

This paper introduces an innovative concept for next-generation noise cancelingn technology that integrates advanced hardware and software components, including microphones, spectrum analyzers, piezoelectric sensors, and ultrasound transducers. By releasing this technology as open-source framework, we aim to accelerate global innovation, promote sustainability, and enhance accessibiility for all. This document outlines the technical foundation, use cases, and enviornmental guidelines for development.

Introduction:

Noise pollution is a growing concern, affecting mental health, productivity, and quality of life. Current noise-canceling solutions are often limited in range or tailored to specific consumer markets, leaving siginifcant gaps in accessibility and functionality. This project bridges those gaps by combining state-of-the-art technologies into scaleable and adaptable framework.
